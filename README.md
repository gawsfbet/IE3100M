## Inputs
### Example: Jiang Sze has just received an order of 100 product boxes. They are sized 25cm x 20cm x 3.5cm and weigh 300 grams each. By client request, every shipping box must have a buffer of 2cm on all sides of the box. 
#### Field: `Quantity`
The number of product boxes to be packed. Input must be an integer format.<br>
This field is **mandatory**.<br>
*For our example, '100' should be keyed into this field.*<br>
#### Field: `Length`
The length of the product box to be packed, in mm. Input must be an integer format.<br>
This field is **mandatory**.<br>
*For our example, '250' should be keyed into this field (since 25cm = 250mm).*<br>
#### Field: `Width`
The width of the product box to be packed, in mm. Input must be an integer format.<br>
This field is **mandatory**.<br>
*For our example, '200' should be keyed into this field (since 20cm = 200mm).*<br>
#### Field: `Height`
The height of the product box to be packed, in mm. Input must be an integer format.<br>
This field is **mandatory**.<br>
*For our example, '35' should be keyed into this field (since 3.5cm = 35mm).*<br>
#### Field: `Weight`
The weight of the product box to be packed, in kg. Input must be an integer or decimal format.<br>
This field is **mandatory**.<br>
*For our example, '0.3' should be keyed into this field (since 300g = 0.3kg).*<br>
#### Field: `Buffer`
The buffer to add to the sides of the shipping box, in mm.<br>
This field is **optional**. Buffer is assumed to be 0 if there is no input or if input is not in an integer format.<br>
*For our example, '20' should be keyed into this field (since 2cm = 20mm).*<br>
#### Checkbox: `Buffer all sides`
Check if you wish to add the buffer to all 6 sides of the shipping box.<br>
Uncheck if you wish to only add the buffer to 3 sides of the shipping box (right, front, top).<br>
*For our example, this box should be checked, since the client requests for all sides to be buffered.*<br>
